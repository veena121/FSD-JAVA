                <h3>Best food in the country</h3>
                <br><br><p><b>"In Marathi culture, food is considered equivalent to God – “anna he poornabrahma.” A typical Maharashtrian Phodni or tempering (using ghee and select spices) is bound to tantalize the olfactory senses of a Marathi Manus irrespective of regional affiliation. Food, in this culinary culture, is mostly sautéed, stir-fried or slow-cooked under pressure. Fish is shallow-fried and meats stewed until succulent. Vaafavne or steaming is a technique used frequently before items are fried. Cereals such as jowar and bajra, and pulses like toor and Bengal gram are the staples throughout the state, except for the coastal areas where rice is more prevalent. Another defining characteristic of Maharashtrian cuisine is a distinct sweet and sour flavour. Traditionally, jaggery or puran is the favoured sweetener, although sugar is used in equal measure nowadays. A tropical fruit called kokum is used as a souring agent (primarily in the coastal regions) for dishes and imparts a unique pink or purple colour to the food. Another commonly used souring agent is tamarind. A ubiquitous ingredient is coconut, used either in fresh or dried/ powdered form. Peanuts too are added to a wide variety of dishes and form the base for various delectable chutneys. Peanut oil is also used for cooking in the region. The traditional way of setting a platter is known as Taat Vadhany in which all the dishes and accompaniments of a thali (platter) are arranged in a particular order. While salt is placed at the top-centre of the Taat (plate), the dessert occupies the left side of the base. To the left of the salt are served accompaniments to the main meal such as a lemon wedge, chatni, salad etc., and to its right are served the vegetables and the main course or curry, followed by papad and bhakris. Rice is always served in an evenly shaped mound, garnished with ghee."</b>
